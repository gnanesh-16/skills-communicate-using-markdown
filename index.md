# How to Create and Edit a Pull Request on GitHub

This guide will walk you through creating a pull request, editing files, and committing changes.

## Steps to Create a Pull Request

1. **Open the GitHub repository** where your branches are located.
2. Navigate to the **Pull requests** tab.
3. Click **New pull request**.
4. For the branches to compare, select:
   - **Base branch**: `main`
   - **Compare branch**: `start-markdown`
5. Click **Create pull request**.

## Editing the `index.md` File

Once the pull request is created, follow these steps to edit the `index.md` file:

1. In the pull request, go to the **Files changed** tab.
2. Locate the `index.md` file.
3. Click the three dots (`...`) in the upper-right corner of the file view.
4. Select **Edit file** from the menu.

## Adding Headers to Markdown

- To make a heading, use the `#` symbol followed by a space:
  - `#` for H1
  - `##` for H2
  - `###` for H3, and so on up to H6 (`######`).
  
### Example:
```markdown
# Main Header (H1)

## Sub Header (H2)

### Another Sub Header (H3)

This markdown document clearly describes the process, making it easy for team members to follow .
